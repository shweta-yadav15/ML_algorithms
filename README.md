# Predicting House Prices

In this project I focused on Exploratory data analysis (EDA) and adavnaced regression techniques.

* There are five steps in the EDA:
    - Basic Cleaning- handling missing data, outliers and categorical variables
    - Understanding the problem and variables
    - Univariate study- about the dependent variable
    - Multivariate study- relation between dependent and independent variables
    - Test assumptions for multivariate techniques
* Regression techniques used are:
- Linear Regression with Ridge Regularization(L2 Penalty)
- Linear Regression with Lasso regularization (L1 penalty)
- Linear Regression with ElasticNet regularization (L1 and L2 penalty)
- Stacked Linear Regression with LGBM, XGBoost, Gradient Boost and Kernel Ridge.
